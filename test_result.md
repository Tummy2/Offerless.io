# Testing Results for Offerless Job Application Tracker

## Testing Protocol
This file tracks all testing activities and results for the Offerless application. 

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Backend Testing: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for API endpoint testing
- Frontend Testing: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix issues that have already been resolved by testing agents

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always incorporate user feedback and requirements into testing scenarios
- Test user-reported issues with high priority
- Validate fixes against original user requirements
