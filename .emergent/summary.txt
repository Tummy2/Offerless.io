The AI engineer's work primarily involved building a full-stack Job Application Tracker MVP from scratch, named Offerless, based on a detailed problem statement. Initially, the workspace was empty, prompting a complete build. The engineer successfully set up a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for the frontend and Next.js API routes integrated with Supabase for the backend. Key milestones included implementing authentication (email/password, Google OAuth UI), core application CRUD for job applications, and a basic dashboard. The process involved several dependency fixes, environment restarts, and a full project regeneration due to user requests for a clean slate. Critical hydration and form validation errors were identified and fixed. The application is now running locally, with branding updated to Offerless, and provides a functional UI for signup, signin, and adding applications, but requires user-led Supabase database setup for full data persistence and API functionality.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full-stack Job Application Tracker MVP, rebranded as Offerless (domain Offerless.io). It requires a Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod, TanStack Table, and TanStack Query. The backend utilizes Next.js API routes with Supabase (Postgres) for DB + Auth + Row Level Security (RLS). Authentication features include Email/Password and Google OAuth with email verification. The data model specifies , , and  tables with specific fields, indexes, and RLS policies. API routes are required for authentication, applications CRUD (list, create, update, delete), user stats, and a paginated leaderboard (verified emails only). The UI needs pages for sign-in, home/dashboard (with stats and application table), leaderboard, and settings, supporting dark/light themes. Validation uses Zod schemas for . Seed data and a comprehensive README are also required deliverables. The work done so far has focused on building the core UI, authentication flows, application creation/listing, and fixing critical runtime errors.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row Level Security)
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- React Hook Form & Zod for form management and validation
- TanStack Table & TanStack Query for data display and caching
- Environment variables for sensitive configurations
- Local port management (3000, 3001) for development

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js 14 (App Router) full-stack architecture.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
- ****: Defines project metadata and dependencies. Updated to fix  packages and install all required libraries.
- ****: Provides a template for local environment variables. Crucial for user to configure Supabase and OAuth. Created after an initial oversight.
- ****: The root layout component. Modified for global branding Offerless and theme provider integration, including a fix for hydration issues.
- **, **: Authentication UI pages. Updated with Offerless branding and functional forms for email/password and Google OAuth.
- **, **: Next.js API Route Handlers for job application CRUD. Modified to refine data transformation and validation, addressing form submission errors.
- ****: Component for the Add Application form. Heavily modified to fix form validation (Zod schema adherence) and ensure proper field handling upon opening the dialog.
- ****: Theme switching component. Updated with a mounting state check to prevent React hydration errors during server-side rendering.
- ****: SQL file defining database tables (, , ), RLS policies, indexes, and constraints. This is critical for the Supabase database setup.
- ****: Project documentation. Updated with Offerless branding and detailed, step-by-step instructions for Supabase project creation, environment variable setup, database migration, and optional features like seed data and Google OAuth.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the generic Google OAuth icon to display proper branding.
- Implement full CSV import/export functionality.
- Fully implement the leaderboard with real data fetching, sorting, and pagination from Supabase.
- User action: Complete Supabase database setup (linking, pushing migrations, generating types) for full application functionality.

<current_work>
The Offerless job application tracker has its core Next.js 14 (App Router) structure fully regenerated and most essential UI components and API routes in place. The application's branding has been updated from Rejected.gg to Offerless across the UI and documentation. Authentication pages for sign-in and sign-up with email/password and a Google OAuth button are implemented and functional. The dashboard component, while not fully populated with dynamic data yet, includes placeholders for stat cards and an Add Application button. The  for adding new job applications is fully functional with Zod-based form validation, after fixes to address a runtime validation error during submission. The  is structured to support search, filtering, and sorting. A React hydration error related to theme switching was fixed by adding mounting state logic in theme components, ensuring smooth SSR. The application runs locally (currently on  due to port conflicts) and redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. Full database interaction remains dependent on the user completing the Supabase setup as detailed in the .

<optional_next_step>
Ensure the Supabase database is set up as detailed in the README to resolve application creation errors and enable full functionality.
